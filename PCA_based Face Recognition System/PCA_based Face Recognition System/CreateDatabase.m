function T = CreateDatabase(TrainDatabasePath)
% Align a set of face images (the training set T1, T2, ... , TM )
%
% Description: This function reshapes all 2D images of the training database
% into 1D column vectors. Then, it puts these 1D column vectors in a row to 
% construct 2D matrix 'T'.
%  
% 
% Argument:     TrainDatabasePath      - Path of the training database
%
% Returns:      T                      - A 2D matrix, containing all 1D image vectors.
%                                        Suppose all P images in the training database 
%                                        have the same size of MxN. So the length of 1D 
%                                        column vectors is MN and 'T' will be a MNxP 2D matrix.
